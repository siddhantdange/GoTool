This chrome extension tries to redefine bookmarks by allowing one to seamlessly create and navigate to shortcuts.

To Install:

Usage:
type in 'go' and hit tab => GoTool is activated. Type in a shortcut name and hit enter. 

If that shortcut has not been made, you will be directed to an 'add shortcut' page. Once that shortcut has been made, entering GoTol mode and typing in the same title will lead to the saved page. 

To edit shortcuts, enter GoTool mode and search with 'manage'. There you will be able to see all your shortcuts and delete them.

Enjoy!
